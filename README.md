## About the project:

It is essential that we have a system solely committed to helping animals in need, in a hectic environment like ours. Our idea aims to set up a system that provides the user to report the injured animals to the shelter, a location from where they may be taken to a hospital for treatment. The hospital will treat the animal; and order medications for it. Additionally, the shelter offers adoption options and manages donations received for the shelter. The distribution enterprise handles the inventory of pharmaceuticals. Government is used for anaytics. Our mission is to establish an effective system for animal rescue so that the animals can experience safety and love.

The purpose of our project is to establish an animal rescue system, that allows the user to report an injured animal to the shelter. We have created an ecosystem where we manage the shelter, the hospital for injured animals, the distribution of medications, and the government that controls the funding for the shelter. We have 5 Enterprises, 8 Organizations and 13 Role. This displays the resilience of our system. In order to protect injured animals, we strive to offer a simple and user-friendly workflow.
